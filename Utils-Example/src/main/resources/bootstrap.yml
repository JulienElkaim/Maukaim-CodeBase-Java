# Possible way to set up a vault cloud dependency. All secret settled in vault will be added in application-profile.yml files !
# How to handle profiles?
# Under the path  of vault.generic.default-context create a path for each profile (prd, dev, test, uat, ...)
# Vault will get secrets in the path relative to the spring profile.

# This configuration only works with a spring-cloud-starter-vault-config dependency. (See commented in pom.xml

#spring:
#  application:
#    name: appName
#  cloud:
#    vault:
#      enabled: true
#      uri: https://vault.cloud.company/v1/  #Potential uri if company has its own version of vault cloud
#      authentication: APPROLE
#      app-role:
#        role-id: id12345-de-oUF56789
#        secret-id: ${PATH_VARIABLE_VAULT_PASSWORD} # The only secret to get on your side, to input all the others
#      namespace: myVault/TEAM_NAME # If namespace required in authentication
#      generic:
#        enabled: true
#        backend: aName
#        default-context: appNameInTheVaultInstance # Not necessary to be same as spring.application.name

# Maukaim Code Base - Java

Code base for every java features complex to
implement and/or commonly needed in any web projects using 
spring boot.  

## How to read this repository  

It is a collection of modules:  

- **Maukaim module** - The ready-to-use module I use for current / new module 
to add to this code base.  
- **\*\*-SBC-Example module** - The modules exposing a Spring Boot consumer example
of another module.  
- **\*\*-Example module** - The modules where you can find a runnable example. May be directly
the module with the functional code in it, if there is no added value to
split the function and the consumer.
